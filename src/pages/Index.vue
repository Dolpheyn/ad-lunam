      The story of the human civilization going to the moon‚Äìagain, this time
      powered by low cost, reusable rockets.
    </span>
    <div class="text-body1 q-mt-xl">

      <p>
        Our üåüspaceüåü story started in the 20th century, during the Cold War.
        The Soviets launched the first ever man-made object into orbit, the
        Sputnik 1, after advancements in space technology made possible by the
        WWII.  This event triggered what we know today as the Space Race.
      </p>

      <p>
        NASA was born short after. For the next years, two giants‚Äìthe US and the
        Soviets‚Äìmade an international space show by dumping their money to prove
        to the world who has the better technology. The space programs were
        televised to show off their greatness to the world, simultaneously
        making their rival pissed off. For almost a decade later, we saw the
        giants furiously sending men to space, ending with the US sending Neil
        Armstrong to the moon in July of 1969. This continued to the year 1972,
        an by then we have sent a total of 12 humans to walk on the moon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans got super excited. We were expecting to push our boundaries far
        beyond what we were capable of. It was that same feeling of discovering
        again, like when we first sailed across the ocean. However, for the next
        49 years, the people-on-the-moon count is stil...12, and we don't have
        anything new planned, at all. The Space Race was just two giants being
        cocky during a war crisis after all. After it ended with one's satisfied
        ego, and the other's shame, the two nations don't find it worth to spend
        their fortunes to go beyond the orbit anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, that was the case until <span class="bank-gothic text-h6">SpaceX</span>
        shows up.

      <h2>History of <span class="bank-gothic">SpaceX</span></h2>

      <p>
        <span class="bank-gothic text-h6">SpaceX</span>
        <span class="text-strike">
          manufactures and launches the world‚Äôs most advanced
        </span>

        makes and launches cool and badass rockets . The company was founded in
        2002 by Elon Musk to revolutionize space transportation,

        <span class="text-bold">
          with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary.
        </span>
        Musk is famously known for founding Tesla Motors, X.com (later known as
        PayPal) and his first multimillionaire company, Zip2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like any other successful businesses Musk had founded, SpaceX is no
        different.  It became the first privately funded group to put a payload
        in Earth orbit in 2008. Since then, the company has continued to
        impress, launching unmanned cargo vehicles to the International Space
        Station (ISS) and winning a contract from NASA to fly astronauts as
        early as 2017. <span class="text-bold">One of SpaceX‚Äôs most notable
        history-making moments was when its first stage rocket‚Äîthe Falcon
        9üöÄ‚Äîbecame the first one to launch, then autonomously landed upright
        on its feet.</span> Now in 2021, watching SpaceX landing its rockets
        is already a routine.
      </p>

      <p>
        SpaceX makes their rockets from scratch. They keep the outsourcing cost low by
        building roughly 80% from the parts of a rocket in their own factory. In one end
        of their factory comes the raw materials, in the other end, rockets. One study
        by NASA and the Air Force estimated that the price tag of the process, from
        designing to the launching of the Falcon 9 rocket, was about a third of what it
        would have cost NASA.
      </p>

      <p>
        To reach Musk‚Äôs ultimate goal, he figured space travelling costs should be
        lowered, by a lot. So, he made his rockets reusable. After recovery from
        landing, the rockets must be able to be refurbished and reflown in minimal
        time and with minimal cost. Only then can they be reflown, reducing launch
        costs significantly. SpaceX have been successfully doing this. Until May
        of 2021, SpaceX‚Äôs reused flights count is at 61, with the booster with the
        highest flight count being the B1051, sitting at 9 launches.
      </p>

      <p>
        In April 2020, SpaceX made yet another first in history by flying 4
        astronauts in the Crew-2 mission with NASA with reused, or termed by NASA,
        ‚Äúflight proven‚Äù rocket. SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster that launched the Crew-1
        mission in November 2020 is brought to port after landing on an automatic
        drone ship at sea. This booster is reused for the Crew-2 mission, being
        the first rocket booster that has ever been used for multiple human
        launches.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of 2021, SpaceX is actively developing the Starship system, with the
        intent to make it a fully-reusable two-stage launch vehicle, intended to
        replace all of its existing launch vehicles and spacecraft used for
        satellite delivery and human transport‚ÄîFalcon 9, Falcon Heavy and
        Dragon‚Äîand also eventually support flights to the Moon and Mars. In
        addition it could be used for point-to-point transportation on Earth.
