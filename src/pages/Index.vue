      <h2>Human and Space Chronicle</h2>

      <p>
        Our 🌟space🌟 story started in the 20th century, during the Cold War.
        The Soviets launched the first ever man-made object into orbit, the
        Sputnik 1, after advancements in space technology made possible by the
        WWII.  This event triggered what we know today as the Space Race.
      </p>

      <p>
        NASA was born short after. For the next years, two giants–the US and the
        Soviets–made an international space show by dumping their money to prove
        who has the better technology to the world. The space programs were
        televised to show off their greatness to the world, simultaneously
        pissing their rival off. For almost a decade later, we saw the giants
        furiously sending men to space, ending with the US sending Neil
        Armstrong to the moon in July of 1969. This continued to the year 1972,
        an by then we have sent a total of 12 humans to walk on the moon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans got super excited. We were expecting to push our boundaries far
        beyond what we were capable of. It was that same feeling of discovering
        again, like when we first sailed across the ocean. However, for the next
        49 years, the people-on-the-moon count is stil...12, and we don't have
        anything new planned, at all. The Space Race was just two giants being
        cocky during a war crisis, after all. After it ended with one's satisfied
        ego, and the other's shame, the two nations don't find it worth to spend
        their fortunes to go beyond the orbit anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, that was the case only until <span class="bank-gothic text-h6">SpaceX</span>
        showed up.
      </p>

      <h2>History of <span class="bank-gothic">SpaceX</span></h2>

      <p>
        <span class="bank-gothic text-h6">SpaceX</span>
        <span class="text-strike">
          manufactures and launches the world’s most advanced
        </span> makes and launches
        <span class="text-italic"> cool and badass rockets</span>. The company
        was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to revolutionize space transportation,

        <span class="text-bold">
          with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary.
        </span>
        Musk is famously known for founding Tesla Motors, X.com (later known as
        PayPal) and his first multimillionaire company, Zip2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like any other successful businesses Musk had founded, SpaceX is no
        different.  It became the first privately funded group to put a payload
        in Earth orbit in 2008. Since then, the company has continued to
        impress, launching unmanned cargo vehicles to the International Space
        Station (ISS) and winning a contract from NASA to fly astronauts as
        early as 2017. One of SpaceX’s most notable history-making moments was
        when its first stage rocket—the Falcon 9🚀—became the first one to
        launch, <span class="text-bold">then autonomously landed upright on its
          feet.</span> Now in 2021, landing its rockets is already a
        routine for SpaceX.

      <h2>Reusable Rockets 🚀</h2>

      <p>
        <span class="bank-gothic text-h6">SpaceX</span> makes their rockets from
        scratch. They keep the outsourcing cost low by building roughly 80% from
        the parts of a rocket in their own factory. In one end of their factory
        comes the raw materials, in the other end,
        <span class="text-italic">rockets</span>. One study by NASA and the Air
        Force estimated that the price tag of the process, from designing to the
        launching of the Falcon 9 rocket, was about
        <span class="text-bold">a third of</span> what it would have cost NASA,
        shaving millions of dollars off of each launches.
      </p>

      <!-- Make reuse flight number reusable -->
      <p>
        To reach Musk’s ultimate goal, he figured space travelling costs should be
        lowered, by a lot. So, he made his rockets reusable. After recovery from
        landing, the rockets must be able to be refurbished and reflown in minimal
        time, and with minimal cost. Only then can they be reflown, reducing launch
        costs significantly. Not surprisingly, Musk and SpaceX have been
        successfully doing this. Until May of 2021, SpaceX’s reused flights
        count is at 61, with the booster at the highest flight count being the
        B1051, sitting at <span class="text-bold">10 launches!</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        In April 2020, SpaceX made yet another first in history by flying 4
        astronauts in the Crew-2 mission with NASA with reused, or termed by NASA,
        “flight proven” rocket. SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster that launched the Crew-1
        mission in November 2020 is brought to port after landing on an automatic
        drone ship at sea. This booster is reused for the Crew-2 mission, being
        the first rocket booster that has ever been used for multiple human
        launches.
      </p>

      <p>
        SpaceX's reusable rockets are already proven to be safe, flight proven
        and have been used by many customers around the world. Their
        customers includes big names like NASA, the USAF, and South Korea! These
        customers have been using SpaceX's services for launching surveillance,
        and scientific satellites. Let's explore who have been using SpaceX's
        reusable rokets thar are provided by their services.

      <h2>The Starship</h2>

      <p>
        As of 2021, SpaceX is actively developing the Starship system, with the
        intent to make it a fully-reusable two-stage launch vehicle, intended to
        replace all of its existing launch vehicles and spacecraft used for
        satellite delivery and human transport—Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and
        Dragon—and also eventually support flights to the Moon and Mars. In
        addition, it could be used for point-to-point transportation on Earth.
